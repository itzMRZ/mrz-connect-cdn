## ⚠️ MINOR ISSUES FOUND

### 1. Extraneous Exam Backup File
**Issue:** `backups/20251005_0518_Fall2025_exams.json` exists  
**Impact:** Minor - Not indexed, doesn't break anything  
**Recommendation:** Remove manually or update cleanup script to delete non-connect backups

### 2. Duplicate Fall2025 Archived Backups
**Issue:** Two Fall2025 archives exist:
- `20251005_0518_Fall2025_connect.json` (Oct 4 data)
- `20260123_2359_Fall2025_connect.json` (Oct 5 data)

**Impact:** Minor - Wastes ~3.4 MB storage  
**Cause:** Likely from testing/manual runs  
**Recommendation:** Keep the one with final exam date (20260123), delete the other

## 🔍 EDGE CASES HANDLED

### Script Handles:
- ✅ Empty or missing section data
- ✅ Missing exam dates (LAB sections)
- ✅ No existing backups (creates first one)
- ✅ Same semester updates (overwrites current backup)
- ✅ Semester changes (archives old, creates new)
- ✅ Network failures (raises exception with message)
- ✅ Missing metadata fields (uses `.get()` with defaults)

### Potential Unhandled Cases:
- ⚠️ Corrupted backup files (will fail silently on read error)
- ⚠️ Multiple current backups (only processes first match)
- ⚠️ Disk space issues (no check before writing files)

## 🚀 RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate (Optional):
1. Clean up duplicate/extraneous backup files:
   ```bash
   rm backups/20251005_0518_Fall2025_exams.json
   rm backups/20251005_0518_Fall2025_connect.json
   ```

### Future Enhancements:
1. Add disk space check before writing large files
2. Add backup file validation/repair function
3. Implement rate limiting for API calls
4. Add monitoring/alerting for workflow failures
5. Consider implementing backup rotation beyond 2 years
