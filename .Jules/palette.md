**Learning:** Developers frequently need to copy-paste code snippets from documentation. Adding a dedicated "Copy" button reduces friction and improves the developer experience significantly.
**Action:** When designing documentation pages, always include a "Copy" button for code blocks.

**Action:** Always provide "Copy" buttons for API endpoint URLs in documentation, not just for the code samples.
