**Learning:** The `requests` library in Python makes it very easy to handle ETags manually. Storing the ETag in a simple text file (`connect.etag`) is a sufficient and lightweight persistence mechanism for this use case.
**Action:** When working with scripts that periodically fetch data, always check if the upstream server supports ETags or Last-Modified to avoid redundant downloads.
